This example shows how files can be embedded at build-time using the Battery-Embed tool.
The binary data is stored in the executable and can be easily accessed as a string.

All of this text you are reading right now is not hard-coded, it was written as a resource file.
Any file type can be embedded as it's just a byte array - The most common uses for such 
embedded files would be:

    - Small configuration files (like Json or XML files)
        or files used for templating (like when generating other files for the user)

    - Long, multi-line strings that would be irritative to write in code, such as
        descriptive text (like the one you are reading), 
        GLSL/HLSL shader code or
        base-64 encoded data

    - Binary resources such as
        icon files,
        color palette files,
        images/banners/background images,
        language files or
        small audio files

What embedding is NOT to be used for:

    - Embedding very large files (>50Mb), as this bloats the executable size 
        and will take forever to compile. In some cases it might not even compile because
        the compiler needs too much RAM, just to compile the gigabytes of C-array.

    - If very large resource files are used, it is recommended to ship the resource files 
        with the executable and then load them from disk at runtime.
